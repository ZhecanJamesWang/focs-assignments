I. Math

In the following problems, we will look at how rapidly different functions grow.  We are interested in figuring out when two functions grow at the same rate.  Our definition of “the same” is:  f(n) grows no faster than g(n) if there is some minimum value for the argument (we’ll call it n0) after which f(n) is no larger than a constant multiple of g(n) -- call it k*g(n).  For example, if f(n) is 367n+1098 and g(n) is 2n, n0 could be 40 and k could be 200:  367n+1098 <= 200*2n for n>40.

For each of the following pairs of functions, identify a multiplier and a minimum value of n for which the first is no larger than the specified multiple of the second.  If you cannot -- if there are no such values -- explain why not.


  A. 367n+1098     and     2n                  [n0 = 40; k=200]
  B. n^2 + 2n + 6    and     6n^2 - 25
 
  n0 = 3, k = 1
  After n0 = 3, 6n^2 - 25 will be greater than n^2 + 2n + 6 

  C. n^3 + n^2 - 2n     and     6n^2 - 25
  I cannot find n0 and k since the leading order term in the first polynomial is bigger than the leading order term in the second polynomial.


  D. 869,438    and    923
  n0 = anything, k = 1000

  E. 2^n    and    3^n
  n0 = 0, k = 1

  F. 3^n    and    2^n
  I cannot find n0 and k since the base of the exponetial at the first one is bigger than the base of the exponetial at the second one

  G. log_2 n     and    log_10 n    [NB:  these are intended to be log-base-2 of n and log-base-10 of n]
  n0 = 1, k = 10
  H. log_10 n^2    and     log_2 n
  n0 = 1, k = 1

II. Linear data structures

For the following problem, assume that it costs 1 unit to access a structure -- an item in an array, a field in a record you are holding, the first element in a linked list -- whether reading or writing that element.  [Accessing the second element in a linked list costs 2 units if you have a pointer to the list:  1 unit to access the first element/read its “next” pointer, and another unit to access the second element.]

Assume that you have n elements stored in an array and the same n elements stored in a linked list; you have no other references to these data structures.  You may assume that n > 10.  How much does it cost to perform each of the following actions?

  A. Read the value of the first element in the array?  In the list?

  O(1) for array. 
  O(1) for list.

  B. Read the value of the seventh element in the array?  In the list?

  O(1) for array.
  O(7) for list.

  C. Add an element to the array?  [Where is the cheapest place to add it?]  To the list?  [Where is the cheapest place to add it?]

  O(n) for adding an element to the array. the cheapest place to add is the end of the array.


  O(n) for traversing to the end of the list (or to the adding point of the list)
  O(1) for actually adding an element to the list and the cheapest place to add is at the head of the list.

  D. Delete the fifth element from the array?  From the list?
 
  O(n - 5) -> O(n) for deleting the fifth element from the array.

  O(5) for locating the fifth element in the list and then O(1) for actually deleting the fifth element from the list. 

  E. Confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array?  In the list?

   O(n) for checking if the element is in the array.
   O(n) for checking if the element is in the list.   
 
  F. Confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is NOT present in the array?  In the list?

   O(n) for checking if the element is NOT in the array.
   O(n) for checking if the element is NOT in the list.   

Now assume that you can maintain one extra piece of storage for the data structure.  In the case of the array, you may want to maintain a length reference.
In the case of the linked list, what would be similarly helpful?

store the end node of the linked list

G. How much would it cost now to add an element to the end of the array?  To add an element to the end of the list?

O(1) to add an element to the end of the array.
O(1) to add an element to the end of the list.


H. How much would it cost now to delete an element from the array?  From the list?  What if it were the final element?  The penultimate element?

  O(n) for deleting an element from the array.
  O(n) for locating the nth element in the list and then O(1) for actually deleting the nth element from the list. 

  O(1) for deleting the final element from the array.
  O(1) for deleting the final element from the list.

  O(1) for deleting the penultimate element from the array.
  O(2) for deleting the penultimate element from the list.

Finally, assume that both the array and the linked list are sorted, i.e., that their elements are in some predictable order (say, comparable by < or <=).
  J. How much would it cost to confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array?  In the list?  To confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is not present in the array?  In the list?

  
  log(n) to confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the array
  O(n) to confirm that a particular element -- say x -- is present in the list 

  log(n) to confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is not present in the array
  O(n) to confirm that a particular element -- say y -- is not present in the list
