## 0. [Not a question] Terminology

In class on Monday, we drew [**call graphs**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) of the `fib` function, with and without memoization.

This particular kind of call graph is a **dynamic call graph**, whose nodes are function *invocations* during the execution of a program. The nodes of a **static call graph** are function *names*; arrows indicate appearances of a call in the program source text.

A dynamic call graph of a *recursive* function is also called a **recursion graph**.

## 1. Predicate Calculus – Models

Consider Table 1:

| x    | y    |
| ---- | ---- |
| a    | b    |
| b    | c    |
| a    | c    |
| c    | d    |
| d    | c    |
| c    | c    |
| b    | a    |

*Table 1*: A model for `loves(x, y)`

a. For each of the following, is Table 1 a model?  Explain briefly why or why not.

1. ∃x. ∀y. loves(x, y)
Not a model. Since there is not a x value in the table that loves every possible y values.

2. ∃y. ∀x. loves(x, y)
Yes. Since every possible value of x loves c value.

3. ∀x. ∃y. loves(x, y)
Yes. Since every possible value of x loves some possible values (may be just one) of y.

4. ∀y. ∃x. loves(x, y)
Yes. Since for every possible value of y, there are some possible values (may be just one) of x that loves this y value.

5. ∃x. ∃y. loves(x, y)
Yes. Since some x value does love some y value in the table.

6. ∃x. ∀y. ¬loves(x, y)
Not a model. Since every x values loves some y value in the table.

7. ∃x. ¬∀y. loves(x, y)
Yes. There is some x value in the table that does't love every possible value of y.

b. Consider three models: (i) objects are a, b, c, d; `loves` is Table 1; (ii) objects are integers; `loves(x, y) ` ≝ x ≧ y; (iii) `loves(x, y)` ≝ x = y. In which of these models are these statements true:

| Statement                                | Table 1 | x ≧ y | x = y |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ----- |
| ∀x, x. loves(x, x)                       |   F     |  T    |   T   |
| ∀x, y. loves(x, y) → loves(y, x)         |   F     |  F    |   T   |
| ∀x, y, z. loves(x, y) ∧ loves(y, z) → loves(x, z) |    F    |   T   |   T   |

c. (Optional) (Because we love graphs) Draw Table 1 as a digraph. What claims do each of the following make about a node x or y, in terms of its indegree and outdegree?

1. ∀x. loves(x, y)
2. ∀y. loves(x, y)
3. ∃x. loves(x, y)
4. ∃y. loves(x, y)

## 2. Predicate Calculus – Proofs

Given axioms:

1. ∀x. sum( x, 0, x )
2. ∀x, y, z. sum( x, y, z ) → sum( x, s(y), s(z) )
3. ∀x . product( x, 0, 0 )
4. ∀x, y, z, k. product( x, y, z ) ∧  sum( x, z, k ) → product( x, s(y), k )

Prove:

1.  ∃x. sum( x, x, s(s(0)) )
For x = 1 and s(0) = 0 + 1 = 1,
then s(s(0)) = (0 + 1) + 1 = 2.
Since x + x = 1 + 1 = 2, 
thus x + x = s(s(0)).
So ∃x. sum( x, x, s(s(0)) ) is valid.


2.  ∀x. sum( 0, x, x ) [hint:  induction]
Proposed Theoream:
    ∀x. sum( 0, x, x ) 
Base cases:
    P(0): 0 + 0 = 0
    P(1): 0 + 1 = 1
    P(2): 0 + 2 = 2
    P(3): 0 + 3 = 3

Inductive Hypothesis:
    P(k) is true for 0, 1, 2, 3 ... j, j >= 3.

Inductive Steps:
    We want to prove that P(k + 1) is true (0 + k + 1 = k + 1 is true,) based on the prior knowledge of P(k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ... j, j >= 3. Since P(k) is true based on the inductive hypothesis, we know 0 + k = k is true. If we add 1 on both side of the equation, based on the property of equation, 0 + k + 1 = k +1 is still true since we add the same number on both sides of a valid equation. Thus, we prove that P(k + 1) is true based on the prior knowledge of P(k) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3 ... j, j >= 3. So the Proposed Theoream ∀x. sum( 0, x, x ) is valid.


3.  [optional super-challenge] ∀x, y, z. sum( x, y, z ) → sum( y, x, z )

## 3. Maximum Subarray

The [maximum subarray problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_subarray_problem) (*aka* maximum contiguous subsequence, *aka* maximum value contiguous subsequence) is “the task of finding the contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum. For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6” ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/)).

```python
# Source: wikipedia 
def max_subarray(xs):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = 0
    for x in xs:
        max_ending_here = max(0, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far
```

a. Draw a recursion graph of `max_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4])`.
This function is not recursive so there is not recursion graph for it.

b. Is `max_subarray` an example of divide and conquer? Why or why not?
It is not an example of divide and conquer since it does not divide the problem recursively into sub-problems to solve.


c. Is `max_subarray` an example of dynamic programming? Why or why not?
It is not an example of dynamic programming since it does not break the problems into sub-porblems and store any reused solutions.

d. Consider a *memoized* version of `max_subarray`. (You don't need to produce code for this. You do need to understand what memoization does to a call graph.) Draw the recursion graph for `memoized_max_subarray([−2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4])`.
The original function is not recursive so I could not modify it to be memoized.

e. [Optional challenge] Produce working code for memoized `max_subarray`.

## 4. Binary Search

```python
def binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, left, right):
    if left == right: return None
    middle = int((left + right) / 2)
    if x < xs[middle]:
        return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, left, middle)
    elif xs[middle] < x:
        return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, middle, right)
    else:
        return middle

def binary_search_array(x, xs):
    return binary_search_array_helper(x, xs, 0, len(xs))
```

a. Above is an implementation of the [binary search algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm). Draw the recursion graph for `binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))`.
 
![alt text](https://github.com/ZhecanJamesWang/focs-assignments/blob/master/day19/Document1%20Microsoft%20Word%2C%20Today%20at%2012.11.42%20AM.png "Logo Title Text 1")
                       
 
b. Is `binary_search_array` an example of divide and conquer? Why or why not?
Yes, since it recursively divides the array into sub-arrays every time to solve the problem.

c. Is `binary_search_array` an example of dynamic programming? Why or why not?
It is not an example of dynamic programming since even though it does break down the problems into sub-porblems but it doesn't store any reused solutions.

d. Consider a memoized version of `binary_binary_search_array_helper`. Draw the recursion graph for a function memoized `memoized_binary_search_array(3, [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]))` that calls `memoized_binary_search_array_helper`.
![alt text](https://github.com/ZhecanJamesWang/focs-assignments/blob/master/day19/Document1%20Microsoft%20Word%2C%20Today%20at%2012.17.48%20AM.png "Logo Title Text 1")
    

e. Under what circumstances does the `memoized_binary_search_array` present any benefits over the unmemoized original? How does this relate to (i) its recursion graph; (ii) the key attributes of a dynamic program?
When there are a lot of repetitive arrays in the data for processing, `memoized_binary_search_array` should present benefits over the unmemoized original. As in the recursion graph, when the `memoized_binary_search_array` takes an array argument, it will first check to see if it is one of the pre-calculated arrays and return the stored solutions if needed in order to save time. This shows the key attributes of dynamic programming that storing the reused solutions to increase time efficiency.


f. [Optional challenge] Find the bug in `binary_search_array`. What input will cause it to fail? How can this be fixed? (Hint: it is a bug that appears for small arrays. Python is not susceptible to [this bug](https://research.googleblog.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html).)
